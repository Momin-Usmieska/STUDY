# Components of Computer System

### Hardware Components
#### Definition:
refers to the physical parts of a computer that you can touch and see. It includes both internal components that provide computing power and external peripherals for i/o functions.

#### Internal Hardware Components:
###### Central Procession Unit(CPU):
- brain of computer, performs all instructions form software.
- responsible for executing commands and processing data.
###### Memory(RAM - Random Access Memory):
- temporary storage that provides space for CPU to read and write data for ongoing tasks.
- allows quick access to data, making it faster to perform operations.
###### Storage Devices:
- Hard Disk Drive (HDD): Traditional magnetic storage device for long-term data storage.
- Solid State Derive (SSD): Faster and more reliable storage device using flash memory.
- used for storing operating systems, software, and personal files.
###### Motherboard: 
- Main Circuit board connection all internal components.
- Houses the CPU, memory, and provides ports for external peripherals.
###### Power Supply Unit (PSU):
- Convert electrical power from an outlet to a usable form for the computer.
- Supplies power to all internal components.
###### Graphical Processing Unit (GPU):
- Specialized processor for rendering images, videos, and animations.
- Critical for gaming, video editing , and applications requiring high graphical performance.
###### Cooling System:
- Includes fans and heat sinks to keep components cool and prevent overheating.
- Ensures optimal performance and longevity of the system.
###### Optical Drives:
- Devices like CD/DVD drives used to read and write data from optical discs.
- Becoming less common due to the rise of USB and cloud storage.

#### External Hardware Components (Peripherals):

###### Input Devices:
- Keyboard, mouse,scanner, microphone,etc.
- Allows the user to interact with the computer.
###### Output Devices:
- Monitor, printer,speaker, etc.
- Displays information and results of computations to the user.
###### Input/Output Devices:
- Devices like touchscreens and network cards that server both input and output purposes.


### Software Components

#### Definition:
It refers to a set of instructions or programs that tell the hardware how to perform tasks.

#### System Software:

###### Operating System (OS):
- Manages hardware resources and provides services for application Software.
- Examples: Windows, mac OS, Linux, Android, iOS.
###### Device Drivers:
- Specialized programs that allow the OS to communicate with hardware components like printers, graphics cards, and USB devices.
###### Utilities:
- Programs that perform maintenance tasks and optimize system performance.
- Examples: Antivirus software, disk cleanup tools , and file management utilities.
#### Application Software:

###### Productivity Software:
- Software designed to help users perform specific tasks such as document creation, spreadsheets , and presentations.
- Examples: Microsoft Office Google Docs, Adobe Photoshop.
###### Database Software:
- Software used to create, manage, and query databases.
- Examples: MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.
###### Web Browsers:
- Software used to browse the internet.
- Examples: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari.
###### Specialized Software:
- Software developed for specific tasks like graphic design, programming, and CAD.
- Examples: AutoCAD, MATLAB, Visual Studio.


#### Programming Software:

###### Compilers:
- Converts high-level programming languages into machine code.
- Examples: GCC(GNU Compiler Collection), Microsoft C++ Compiler.
###### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
- Tools for writing, testing, and debugging code.
- Examples: Visual Studio, Eclipse, PyCharm.
