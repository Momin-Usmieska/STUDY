# Memory and Storage

## Memory
Memory is used by the computer to store data temporarily while tasks are being executed. There are two main types of memory : *RAM* and *ROM*.

### Random Access Memory (RAM):
#### Definition:
RAM is a type of volatile memory, meaning it loses its data when the power is turned off. It temporarily stores data that the CPU needs to access quickly.

#### Function:
RAM holds the data and instructions for programs that are currently being executed. The more RAM a system has, the more programs it can run simultaneously without  slowing down.

#### Types of RAM:
##### DRAM (Dynamic RAM):
Requires constant refreshing to maintain its data. It is commonly used in personal computers.

##### SRAM (Static RAM):
Does not need to be refreshed, making it faster than DRAM. However, it is more expensive and typically used for CPU Cache.

##### DDR (Double Data Rate) RAM:
Modern DRAM type like DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5, offer faster data transfer rates by sending data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal.

##### Use Case:
General Computing tasks, running applications, and handling data while a computer is in use.


### Read-Only Memory (ROM):
#### Definition:
ROM is a type of non-volatile memory, meaning it retains its data even when the power is turned off. It is primarily used to store firmware or system-level software.

#### Function:
ROM Stores the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), which initializes hardware components and loads the operating system when the computer is powered on.

#### Types of ROM:
##### PROM (Programmable ROM):
Can be written once, but not erased.
##### EPROM(Erasable Programmable ROM):
Can be erased and rewritten by exposing it to ultraviolet light.
##### EEPROM (Electric Erasable Programmable ROM):
Can be erased and rewritten electronically, commonly used in BIOS Chips

#### Use Case:
Storing system firmware, boot instructions, and critical configuration data.



## Storage
Storage refers to the devices and components that hold data permanently, even when the system is powered off.

### Hard Disk Drive (HDD):

### Solid State Drives (SSD):
#### Definition:
An SSD is a newer storage device that uses flash memory (non-volatile) to store data. It has no moving parts, making it faster and more reliable than HDDs.
#### Function:
SSDs provide much faster data access and transfer speed than HDDs. Data is stored in NAND flash memory, which allows for quicker boot times, application loading, and file transfers.
#### Performance:
SSDs are significantly faster than HDDs, especially in tasks requiring frequent data access.
#### Advantages:
Faster read/write speeds, more reliable (no moving parts), lower power consumption.
#### Disadvantages:
